### [COPY EVERYTHING BELOW THIS LINE]

**Act as an expert B2B Lead Generation Agency Founder and Operations Master.**
I am building a Lead Generation Agency using my custom SaaS software called "Productive You". I need a complete, step-by-step Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) and business plan on how to run my entire agency inside this specific software.

Here is the existing infrastructure of my software:

1. **Research Engine**: It takes a prompt (e.g., "Find me B2B SaaS companies in South Africa"), scrapes the web using Serper/Jina/Puppeteer, and uses Gemini/Groq to extract highly structured insights and an array of Leads (Name, Company, Email, Industry, Pain Points, Suggested DM).
2. **Sales CRM**: I have a standard Pipeline (Discovery -> Qualification -> Proposal -> Won/Lost) where I can track Deals and Client interactions (Emails, Meetings, Comm logs).
3. **Execution Tracker**: I have a planning hierarchy (YearPlan -> QuarterPlan -> MonthPlan -> WeekPlan -> DayPlan) with specific TimeBlocks and task timers to manage my daily energy and output.

**What I need from you:**
Create a comprehensive, visually structured plan (using markdown tables and step-by-step workflows) on how I will run a 6-figure Lead Generation Agency entirely within this system.

Please structure the output as follows:

### Phase 1: The Productized Service

- Define 3 clear "Lead Generation" packages I can sell to clients (e.g., "The Cold Email Engine", "AI Scraping Leads") and exactly how I will fulfill them using my Research Engine.

### Phase 2: Daily Operations Flow (The SOP)

- Break down the exact start-to-finish workflow of acquiring a client, onboarding them, running the Research Engine, and delivering the leads.
- Map out exactly which features of "Productive You" I will use at each step (e.g., "Use _WeekPlan_ to schedule client check-ins", "Use _Pipeline_ to track the client's sales cycle").

### Phase 3: Scaling & Automation Strategy

- Based on the current infrastructure, suggest exactly what automations (e.g., Outbound cold email sequencing, PhantomBuster/Unibox integrations, Apollo.io API enrichment, scoped Client Portals) I absolutely need to build next to remove myself from the day-to-day operations.

### Phase 4: The 90-Day Execution Plan

- Give me a step-by-step Quarter Plan containing 3 big objectives (QuarterFocus) and the specific Month/Week plans to get my first 5 agency clients signed and onboarded.

Make the response highly actionable, visually clean, and specifically tailored to leveraging a custom LLM-powered scraping and CRM platform.
